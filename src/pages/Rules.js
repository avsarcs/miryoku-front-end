                        <h4><u>Why are there two different descriptions?üßê</u></h4>
                        <div className="margin-bottom">When creating a new artwork, you will be asked to enter a Description and a "Long Description."<br/>
                        Description is limited to 240 characters to make sure it fits to the card representing your artwork on other people's feed. So make it short and compelling.</div>

                         and how it came to be, feel free to ramble on in the Long Description field! It will show on your artwork's page.</div>

                        to flag it and we will review the submitted content as soon as possible.</div>

                        <h3>Point System</h3>
                        <div className="margin-bottom">Each profile starts with 100 points and it takes 10 points to submit one artwork. You can give feedback to artworks to gather points.
                        More people rating your feedback as useful will result in higher gains.</div>

                         <div className="margin-bottom">[Comments] are for general types of reactions like "Woah! Amazing poemüòØ" that spread üíñ love üíñ
                         but don't necessarily provide actionable advice. You can also use comments for any general discussion about the artwork.</div>
                         <div className="margin-bottom">[Feedback] is for providing constructive, actionable advice to the creator of the artwork to help them improve.
                         In order to gather points, write feedbacks.</div>

                         <div className="margin-bottom">You can rate artworks and feedbacks using the stars attached to them. Try to rate everything
                         you see, it is a kind of feedback in itself and helps people! You can also track the rating of your own artworks and feedbacks from your profile.</div>
